part 2

generate key on offline computer
use livecd ( on usb stick )

then transfer the keys on a network computer.


gui for creating master keys : 

seahorse

mac gpg suite.

----------------------

we create two keys using gpg2
public key - signing and certifying (SC)
subkey - used for encrypting (E)

signing is an action against arbitrary data
certifying is signing of another key

certifying a key is known as key signing ( what )

gpg creates signing only key using master key and creates an encryption key i.e.  subkey automatically

without subkey for encryption , we cannot have encrypted emails
subkeys are a seperate key pair
but automatically associated with the main key pair

use primary key for signing and certifying a key
and use seperate subkey for E for day to day use.





commands
sudo apt-get install haveged gnupg2 gnupg-agent libpth20 pinentry-curses libccid pcscd scdaemon libksba8 paperkey opensc


gpg2 --gen-key


1.RSA AND RSA default.
2.DSA and Elgamal
3.DSA sign only
4. RSA sign only

rsa keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long


masterkey pair exported

we want to add subkeys.

gpg2 --expert --edit-key ID

gpg2 -k

addkey
4 rsa sign only ( for a subkey - for day to day uses - sign only - gpg will automatically use the latest key generated )

gpg --output bobs.gpg-revocation-certificate --gen-revoke KEYID

0 - no reason specified
1- key compromised
2 - key is superseded
3 - key is no longer used
q - cancel



gpg2 --export-secret-keys -armor bob@bob.com > bob.private.gpg.asc ( export private key through command line )
gpg2 --export -armor bob@bob.com > bob.public.gpg.asc ( export public key through command line )

gpg2 --export-secret-subkeys bob@bob.com > subkeys ( export subkeys (encryption keys for day to day usage) through command line )

gpg2 --delete-secret-key bob@bob.com

delete this key from the keyring

gpg2 --list-secret-keys

gpg2 --import subkeys

shred --remove subkeys
gpg2 --list-secret-keys


sec# indicates that secret key is not present.


revoke keys and subkeys

gpg2 --import bob.private.gpg.asc
gpg2 --edit-key bob@bob.com



key 2
revkey  (revoke key )
