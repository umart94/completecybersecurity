pinning - process of associating a host with expected x509 certificate or public key.

i will only accept one specific public key.
tie it to fingerprint or hash

be anonymous

if vpn or tor is used if fake certificate is issued. then no data can be associated with us.

vpn will not protect.. anonymizers will protect more.



VPN IPSEC SSH HTTPS SSL / TLS ---> after it reaches vpn terminator ----> traffic comes out as https

if intercepted, then the certificate can be changed.
