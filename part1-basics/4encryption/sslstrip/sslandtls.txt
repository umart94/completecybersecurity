data integrity , message authentication codes.
depends on cipher and client mitigations.
provides end to end security services like confidentiality authentication integrity.

a symmetric algorithm such as aes is used to encrypt data transmitted
keys are generated uniquely for each connection
based on negotiation at the start of the communication.

message integrity checks
TLS supports many methods.


forward secrecy means that session keys wont be compromised even if server private key is compromised.
unique session key for each session a user creates even compromise of a single session key will not affect any data


if private key of server is compromised.
it means all our previous communication wont be compromised and cannot be decrypted
as we use diffie hellman to negotiate sessions keys used for only a short time..

symmetric keys are used in encryption , these are quicker to work with than the private keys generation. for e.g diffie hellman.


hashes and macs used for data integrity.
