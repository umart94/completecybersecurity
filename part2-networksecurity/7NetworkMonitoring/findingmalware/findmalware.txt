in wireshark preferences - enable name resolution of IPS.

in wireshark capture filter settings, we can capture according to specific rules.

it has only external traffic capture rules (no arp)
or either capture tcp or udp traffic only.

we can set up custom filter rules.


we have 2 ways : 

1. is filter on the interface itself.
2. is filter on the captured packets file.

wireshark has built in filters for protocols that it understands.

not(tcp.port==80) - this will remove tcp port 80 traffic from the file

not(tcp.port==80) and not(tcp.port==443) - remove all web traffic


not(tcp.port==80) and not(tcp.port==443) and not (udp.port==53) - this will get rid of dns

right click apply as filter selected, not selected, add to not selected, add to selected

dot dns || http || ssl

not smb || nbns  || dcerpc || nbss
these are the standard windows protocols.

local network only : 

ip.src == 192.168.100.0/24 and ip.dst == 192.168.100.0/24


external network connection to internal network : 

dst is machine to scan
ip.dst == 192.168.100.123 and !ip.src == 192.168.100.0/24







USE a username password entering service, for testing

and then enter username and password and test it.

to look for http

search

http

in filter

to look for

http.request.method == POST


if we right click on http traffic
and click on follow tcp stream
it will put together all the requests and show us in gui.



will also show cookie with its name.


in statistics go to conversations
run packet capture for a while
and then observe ipv4 and ipv6 traffic for any irregular network activity.

right click -> apply as filter.

tools like sysdig lsof netstat etc.
to investigate what is wrong with network.

network monitoring

WinPCap , point wireshark at it
it captures packets on windows devices

remote windows packet capturing ( like ssh on linux)

Network Security Toolkit NST 22

NetworkMiner - protocol analyzer
it works on linux
and on windows we have NetWorx
