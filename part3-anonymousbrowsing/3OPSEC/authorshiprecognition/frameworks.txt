signature stylometry tool

Anti stylometry tools : 
reLANG


mitigation to automated recognition includes :

use authorship evasion tools
use multiple sub aliases
the less you write the better
post text from sources other than yourself
impersonate other users styles
include extra data in posts
if everyone uses leetspeak this makes identification harder.


anonymous coding style can also be tracked.
