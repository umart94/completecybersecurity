Because traditional file transfer and email protocols often lack built-in security, many legacy systems are vulnerable to security breaches. Symantec Command Line Encryption protects critical data to ensure confidentiality and authenticity in trusted data transactions. Powered by PGP technology, it integrates easily into existing business processes and protects information on servers from unauthorized access.
