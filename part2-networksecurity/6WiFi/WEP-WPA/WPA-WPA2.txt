WPA Draft IEEE 802.1 i standard

enhanced security
it used TKIP encryption protocol
temporal key integrity protocol



RC4 - 128 bit per packet key

resulting encryption key would be different for each and every frame

wep key + iv value + mac address = new encryption key.

iv length increased

tkip is backward compatible with 802.11 standard

works with wep by feeding it more keying material
data to be used for generating new dynamic keys

tkip provides a key mixing function

provides rc4 algorithm provides a high degree of protection than wep

sequence counter - relay attacks
message integrity checks.

An attack can be created against WPA(1), in the following case:
 - usage of WPA(1) and TKIP
 - the IPv4 network range is known by the attacker
 - the rekeying (key change) duration is longer than 30 minutes
 - the network supports 802.11e (Quality of Service) with 8 channels

An attacker can detect an ARP packet thanks to its size. As the MAC address is in clear form, the attacker knows most of data (MAC + IPv4 range) which are encrypted in the ARP packet. To obtain the MIC, he can use a rarely used channel. The attacker can then send one packet to each of the 7 left channels.

A vulnerability of the WPA TKIP protocol can therefore be used by an attacker to decode an ARP query and to inject 7 packets.

result:

decrypt arbitrary packets sent to the client
malicious javascript injected.



avoid using tkip

only use tkip when we need backwards compatibility.
