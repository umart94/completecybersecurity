ping works from virtual machine to another virtual machine on the NAT
ping works from virtual machine to external network
ping works from virtual machine to host ip ( the machine which runs vm )


ping does not work from host command line to guest virtual machine.
in NAT , vm is not accessible from external network to internal network.

we can enable access from host into guest through port forwarding

add a new port in virtual network editor
add the virtual machine ip
add the port of vm
add the port, for the host machine, which will be used to connect to 
the ssh port 22 on the virtual machine. through the NAT network mode
using host machine ip.

after that install open ssh on windows 10
then from command line
we have to enter the username on the machine, and ip address = localhost

this will automatically translate to the ip address of the virtual machine
through the port forwarding rule we added.
ssh -p 3004 umartariq@127.0.0.1
