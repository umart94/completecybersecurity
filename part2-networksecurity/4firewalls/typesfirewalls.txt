1. network based firewall
routes traffic through one network to another
2 network connections on a minimum

filter traffic between local network lan to internet ( outbound filtering ) - with network isolation

they work at network and transport layer.
firewall can be on router using iptables.

custom firmware gives firewall with iptables.

disadvantage is that malware simply used ports and protocols that were allowed to communicate out.

2. host based firewalls installed on devices

comodo firewall , windows firewall
iptables - linux


3.network or host based - virtual firewall

e.g Zen Server - virtual machine acting as firewall

laptop use virtual box with a pfsense vm to protect guest virtual machines.
virtual firewall means we dont need a dedicated firewall.

filter traffic on a vm

use internal network pfsense
