The scanner needs a running redis server to temporarily store information
   gathered on the scanned hosts. Redis 2.4 and newer is supported but 2.6
   is recommended. See doc/redis_config.txt to see how to setup and run a redis
   server.

   Two examples are installed which you may use directly for a quick start:

   $ redis-server /share/doc/openvas-scanner/example_redis_2_4.conf

   or

   $ redis-server /share/doc/openvas-scanner/example_redis_2_6.conf

   or copy the example to another location, edit and use the copy instead.
   
   
   Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster
