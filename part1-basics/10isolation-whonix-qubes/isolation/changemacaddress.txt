hardware addresses are traced back to you through a trail.

we can change these hardware addresses ( MAC Randomization )

isolation of this HWaddr

attacker gets mac address off our NIC

the Tor Exploit was used to identify these mac addresses.

commands : 


ipconfig
ifconfig

ip addr

ip a show eth0



first 3 bytes are manufacturer id
next 3 bytes are unique to NIC card.

Technitium MAC Address Changer v6


sudo apt-get install -y macchanger



sudo ifconfig eth0 down


sudo macchanger -r eth0
sudo ifconfig eth0 up


on macs

sudo ifconfig eth0 ether mac_address

macdaddyx
wifispoof


the tails Operating ssystem... changes the mac addresses ( mac address anonymization )
