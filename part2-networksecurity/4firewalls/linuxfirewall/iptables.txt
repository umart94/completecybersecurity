sudo iptables -L
shows the list of chains and rules

3 default chains
INPUT - Controls inbound connections
e.g ping to our device
connect to our device for file share etc.



FORWARD also used for controlling inbound connections
forwarded onto another device, and not to our device
this forwards traffic.


OUTPUT - outbound connections
surf web
enable ports etc.

chains have default behaviour called default policies.


starts from the top and goes through each rule until it matches , else it applies default policy.

drop means no request sent back from / to source.
packet will be dropped

accept

iptables -F ( flush all the rules )


make default rules for each of the chains

we can do it like this : 

iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT


if we want device to only browse the network through browser. then what we can do is drop policy on all the three chains
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT DROP


-A is append , -i is interface , lo is local interface , -j is jump switch , jump to target action matching that rule

sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

sudo iptables -L -v - verbose listing

sudo iptables -L -v --line-number -n

shows numbers instead of names.

 
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
INBOUND DYNAMIC PACKET FILTERING RULE
append to input chain , -m loads a module called state module, examine state of packet and determine if it is new (incoming new connections not initiated by system),
 established or related (incoming packets part of already established connection )
 
to enable dynamic packet filtering.
 
 
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
allow all outgoing packets destined for localhost be allowed and accepted.. requires localhost adapter. lo


sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
outbound traffic DYNAMIC PAKCET FILTERING RULE


if we want to browse network
we have to add these rules :

sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT 

keep TRACKKKK OF THE DOUBLE DASHEESSS


enable dns queries.


sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT

port 80 http port , dynamic packet filter , state as new


sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT


sudo iptables -S
