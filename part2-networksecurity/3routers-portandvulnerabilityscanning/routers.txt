routers have external and internal ip addresses.

network address translation makes sure that we cannot access any device from outside network..

through port forwarding - router will allow external devices on external network to connect to internal devices.



Internet -> Modem -> Router ->Firewall -> Switch


our router device is a combination of these devices.

switches offer more security i.e isolated collision domains.



windows uses firewall
linux uses iptables.

work on network and transport layer.

deep packet insepction firewall , proxy firewall .. can be on layer7.

keep logs of traffic.


LAN to WAN - route table - displayed through route command.

modem - work on physical layer
bridge - forwards packets and filters based on mac addresses - forwards broadcast traffic but not collisions - works on layer2

wireless access point - built into our router  - works on layer 2 - data link layer.
