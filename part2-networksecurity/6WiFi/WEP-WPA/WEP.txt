wep ON WiFi - cracked

1. static encryption keys, no session keys , weak RC4 used , same password
2. Lack of packet integrity assurance - Bits can be changed
3. Ineffective use of initialization vectors, IVS not random enough, only 24 bits, IVS with the same key,
crackable in seconds.

IV is used to make sure patterns are not created

if ivs are not used then 2 plaintexts will create 2 same ciphertexts. upon using an encryption algorithm

IVS are not random enough

Reused IVS with same key - cracked
through
packet injection.


lack of packet integrity assurance
same password is used in entire network.


deprecation of WEP.
