2 virtual machines will be installed.
whonix gateway
whonix workstation


gateway purpose is to enforce network isolation.

workstation ip is changed

malware with root access cannot find the users real ip

we would have to hack the gateway so it is difficult

also with the vm hardware ids and mac addresses are also different and protected.

Nyx - anonymizing relay status monitor for tor network.

badnwidth usage
resource usage
etc.

we can set up tor config to be a relay or bridge.
sdwdate
whonix check

for time sync and updates to OS

torcc file 

DisableNetwork 0
Sandbox 1


global firewall settings




-------------------------
whonix workstation

whonix gateway - acts as transparent tor and socks proxy
transparent means that even if downloaded applications are not configured to use tor
they will use the tor network.
dont need to be configured, will go through tor proxy

all apps use same tor circuit.



hops for tor network



Socks proxied applications
ports they use
preconfigured or not

whonix.org/wiki/Stream_Isolation..

socks proxy.

this protects against identity correlation attacks.

physical isolation ( read docs )


icedove , enigmail , xul-ext-torbirdy

------------------------

whonix weaknesses
wont protect headers or metadata
wont protect against firmware attacks and rootkits
hardware compromises
