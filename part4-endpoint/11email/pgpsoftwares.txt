How can I export my secret or public key?
Use the OpenPGP key manager, which you can find in the global Tools menu bar. Find the key that you would like to export and click it to select it. Then use the window's menu bar to open the File menu, and select either "Export public key" or "Backup secret key" depending on what you require. The OpenPGP key manager also allows you to export public keys of your correspondents.

Alternatively, open Account Settings for the email account of your key that you want to export and select the End-to-End Encryption pane. Next to each personal key is a little small chevron, which you can click to open key details. Click the More button to open a list of possible actions. Select either "Export public key" or "Backup secret key".
