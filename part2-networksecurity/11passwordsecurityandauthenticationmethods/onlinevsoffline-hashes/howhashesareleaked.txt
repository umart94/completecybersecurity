hashes can be extracted from operating systems and hard drives.

in windows they are stored in SAM
The Security Account Manager (SAM) is a database file in Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, 8.1 and 10 that stores users' passwords


can be extracted with various tools

multiple GPU cluster cracks password




hashid ENTER_HASH_HERE

this will try to tell us about the possible type of hash this is.


hashcat -m 0 hashes.txt wordlist.txt -o crackedhashes.txt


crackedhashes.txt will be our output file , we can also specify this.



rule based attacks
take dictionary of input words
change them to other words

rules file

$1 $2 $3 $4
f
:

f - for duplicate words reversed
: for nothing
Reflect	f	Duplicate word reversed	f	p@ssW0rd	p@ssW0rddr0Wss@p

Nothing	:	Do nothing (passthrough)	:	p@ssW0rd	p@ssW0rd	


hashcat -m 0 hashes.txt wordlist.txt -o crackedhashes.txt -- rules rules

pass the hash is when we can use the hash itself to authenticate to a remote server

rather than doing all what we did, i.e extract the hash, convert and get the plaintext, enter plaintext password to authenticate.

instead the hash remains static from session to session, so we can use hash itself to authenticate to the server.
