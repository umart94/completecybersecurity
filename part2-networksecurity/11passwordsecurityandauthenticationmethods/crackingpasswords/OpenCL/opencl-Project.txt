The CPU and Intel® Graphics Technology OpenCL™ Projects contain C++ host target source examples (.cpp files) that use the OpenCL™ host side C API. They also contain an OpenCL-C device target example (.cl files). These examples are helpful for developers new to heterogeneous and OpenCL™ programming. The Empty OpenCL™ Project contains an empty place holder C++ host target source (.cpp), and an empty placeholder device target source (.cl).
