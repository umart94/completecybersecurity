command line network analyzer linux


1. GET all https traffic 

sudo tcpdump -nnSX port 443

2. get everything on an interface

sudo tcpdump -i ens33


sudo tcpdump -D
lists all interfaces

sudo tcpdump -n -i any dst port 80
traffic on any interface for port 80


sudo tcpdump -i ppp0 -vv ip6

sudo tcpdump -i any port 53 or port 80 or port 443



sudo tcpdump -i any host 192.168.100.123 and not src net 192.168.100/24

look on all interfaces for this host

we are not interested on any local traffic
we only want the external traffic.



we can create a wireshark type of capture file

we use -s flag to capture full size bytes of the packets.
-w means write to a file, but this will create a large capture file.
sudo tcpdump -i any -s 65535 -w capturefile.cap
