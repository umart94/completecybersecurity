oswa assistant download.

The OSWA-Assistantâ„¢ is a self-contained, wireless-auditing software toolkit for both IT-security professionals and End-users alike.


This toolkit is squarely focused on wireless security/auditing only and, as the "Assistant" moniker implies, and is designed for the following groups of people:

IT-security auditors and practitioners who need to execute technical wireless security testing against wireless infrastructure and clients;


IT technical staff who have responsibility for ensuring the secure operation and administration of their organization's wireless networks;


SME (Small & Medium Enterprise) and SOHO (SmallOffice-HomeOffice) businesses who do not have either the technical expertise or the resources to employ such expertise to audit their wireless networks;


Non-technical-users who run wireless networks at home and who would like to audit the security of their wireless home networks and laptops but don't know how.
