1. CPU - have no SOFTWARE READABLE SERIAL NUMBER

we can only examine the model number..

CPU-Z software

Linux I-Nex


Mac

MacCPUID


2. motherboards - unique system identifiers.

SMBIOS

wmic used to get this information. about devices on motherboard.

wmic bios get name,serialnumber,version

wmic csproduct get name,identifyingnumber,uuid


DmiDecode for Windows


sudo apt-get install -y dmidecode

macosx brew install cavaliercoder/dmidecode/dmidecode



for disk drive

on windows : 

dir

shows volume serial number

wmic diskdrive get serialnumber


sudo lshw -class disk

lsblk --nodeps -o name,serial


# sudo apt-get install hdparm
# sudo apt-get install smartmontools
# sudo apt-get install lshw


in mac

system_profiler SPSerialATADataType

the device manufacturer could link this serial number back to us.

In terminal type:

# hdparm -I /dev/sd? | grep 'Serial\ Number'
EDIT: You can also use lshw or smartctl

lshw

# lshw -class disk

smartctl

# smartctl -i /dev/sda

If you are missing those tools, just install following packages

# apt-get install hdparm
# apt-get install smartmontools
# apt-get install lshw




Device1 name and corresponding serial number:

lsblk --nodeps -o name,serial
output:

NAME SERIAL
sda  0000000012400917BA30
sdb  0000000012400917BA96
add -n if you don't want to print the header line:

lsblk --nodeps -no name,serial
output:

sda  0000000012400917BA30
sdb  0000000012400917BA96
Pass device as argument to get only the serial number of a specific device:

lsblk --nodeps -no serial /dev/sda
output:

0000000012400917BA30
Keep in mind lsblk lists information about all available (or the specified) block devices. Now, for those who do not know what that last term means:
In general, block devices are devices that store or hold data. Diskette drives, hard drives and CD-ROM drives are all block devices. But that's not a problem when using lsblk as you can simply add more columns e.g type (device type) and/or tran (device transport type) etc:

lsblk --nodeps -no name,serial,type,tran
sda  0000000012400917BA30     disk sata
sdb  0000000012400917BA96     disk sata
