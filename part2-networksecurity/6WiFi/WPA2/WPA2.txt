IEEE 802.11i-2004

WPA2

CCMP

use CCMP
seen as AES

TKIP+AES ( backward compatibility )

best option is CCMP ( AES )

CCMP is an AES based counter mode mechanism ctr

CCM CTR for data confidentiality
and
CBC MAC for authentication and integrity..


AES is slower than TKIP
needs a more powerful access point.




WPA2 Personal - designed for home, does not require authentication server.
256 bit key generated from password


personal mixed mode allows for coexistence of wpa and wpa2 clients on a common SID.


WPA2 ENTERPRISE

802.1X Mode
RADIUS Authentication server
extensible authentication protocol.

create different wireless networks with different security levels.


both wpa and wpa2 are at risk of :
Dictionary
brute force password guessing

attacks

------------------

weakness in salt in wpa and wpa2
both use ssid as salt value

network name = ssid
Salts and SSID should be random values that should be added..
random values in the password and SSID will make password more secure.
