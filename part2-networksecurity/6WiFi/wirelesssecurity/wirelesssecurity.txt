secure and strengthen wifi
including network isolation:


Network isolation

wireless networks and physical networks should be isolated.

VLANS dont work on wifi

in wifi have seperate wifi networks for seperate trust levels.


in dd-wrt we use bridge to enforce seperation on same access point, also firewall rules are used.
untrusted devices only have access to internet

traffic could be allowed from trusted or semi trusted networks to connect inbound to the untrusted ssid.

semi trusted will not be allowed to connect outbound to trusted networks.

trusted devices may choose to connect into semi trusted.

router access points have feature called ap isolation. / wireless isolation.

DLINK has guest zone
link sys
netgear wireless settings also has this functionality.



routers must be kept up to date with latest updated patched firmware.

else use custom updated firmware.



use complex passwords. and complexSSIDs.
wpa2 enterprise
radius authentication server
extensible authentication protocol.

or

WPA2-Personal (WPA-PSK preshared key)
CCMP/AES Encryption
CBC-MAC
Never use WEP or WPA
avoid tkip.


always use SSL/TLS
VPN

disable WPS on router.

if router can implement arpspoof protection . enable that .
pfSense has it built in ( arpwatch)

hide ssid
use ieee 802.1x authentication
eap using eapol and radius.
use mac filtering
reduce max associated clients.

Radio frequency isolation techniques.
