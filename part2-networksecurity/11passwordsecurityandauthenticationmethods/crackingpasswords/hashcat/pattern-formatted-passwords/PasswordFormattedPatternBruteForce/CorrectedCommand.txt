At about 20,000 hashes per second (H/s), my GPU is going to take about 35 more minutes to attempt the remaining passwords in rockyou.txt. Depending on your hardware, your estimated time remaining might be far higher than that. I don’t know about you, but I’m impatient; press Q on your keyboard to quit hashcat.

We’re going to need to adjust our tactics a bit. Instead of attack mode 0—a straight dictionary attack—we’re going to switch to attack mode 3, which is a brute force attack. Our new command will look like this:

1
.\hashcat.exe -m 3200 -a 3 hashes.txt 'SKY-TEST-?d?d?d?d'
Let’s go over the new elements of this command:

-a 3: We’re using attack mode 3 now, which corresponds to a brute force attack. You can get a full list of attack modes and their IDs in the output from .\hashcat.exe -h; there are also more detailed descriptions on hashcat’s website.
Attack mode 3 still only takes a single parameter, but it’s not a wordlist file this time. Instead, we have a mask. This tells hashcat the format of the passwords it should attempt. Let’s break this mask down:
The single quotes surrounding the mask ensure that PowerShell doesn’t interpret any symbols has having a special meaning.
SKY-TEST- is used verbatim in each password.
Each occurrence of ?d will be replaced with a digit; this is called a charset. There are other charsets built into hashcat, and you can define your own. The built-in charsets include:
?l: lowercase letters (a-z)
?u: uppercase letters (A-Z)
?d: decimal digits (0-9)
?h: lowercase hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f)
?H: uppercase hexadecimal digits (0-9, A-F)
?s: basic ASCII symbols (e.g., @)
?a: printable ASCII characters (numbers, letters, symbols)
?b: every possible byte value, from 0x00 to 0xff
With these parameters, hashcat will attempt every password from SKY-TEST-0000 through SKY-TEST-9999, though not necessarily in that order.

Run the command. Depending on your hardware, it may take a little longer than before, but eventually you’ll get the passwords:

Even with a relatively secure algorithm, patterned passwords aren’t secure.
