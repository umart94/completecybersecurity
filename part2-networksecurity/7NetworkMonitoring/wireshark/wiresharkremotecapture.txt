On Linux and OSX you can achieve this by running tcpdump over ssh and having wireshark listen on the pipe.

Create a named pipe:

$ mkfifo /tmp/remote

Start wireshark from the command line

$ wireshark -k -i /tmp/remote

Run tcpdump over ssh on your remote machine and redirect the packets to the named pipe:

$ ssh root@firewall "tcpdump -s 0 -U -n -w - -i eth0 not port 22" > /tmp/remote

sudo ssh root@192.168.100.1 -- "tcpdump -w - -s 65535" 'not port 22' " > capture.pcap

capture the file via ssh
save the file remotely.
