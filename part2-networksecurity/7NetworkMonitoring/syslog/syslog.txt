provides information about network and device to a central location

log messages

rsyslog - on linux
open source

syslog ng replaced with rsyslog

sys log servers supported by lot of network devices

syslog server listens on tcp port 514 and udp port 514
tls port : 6514
accessed through custom firmware on router dd-wrt


it has 8 severity levels standardized levels and keywords

syslog also has concept of facilities
it is a way of categorizing messages ( of processes ) 

when devices send a message to a syslog server it includes 1 of the standard
facility values 

for syslog, in linux ,there is a file called rsyslog.conf in etc.

if we set level to debug, syslog will send us all messages for every
single device, and log everything.

in custom firmware of router dd-wrt for e.g we can enable and disable syslogd
and set ip for remote server.

also in firewall we can enable log levels and set options for dropped, rejected, accepted.

goto router /syslog.asp
this will show those messages.

tail -f /tmp/var/log/messages

this will display messages from command line when we connect to root user of router through command line

and tail is option to constantly refresh it.

ln -s /tmp/var/log/messages /tmp/www/log.html

if we create a symbolic link to the syslog file and then
map it to webserver root then we can see syslog file.

syslogd -h


if we have pfSense ( or an application firewall installed)

we can go to status -> services -> system logs -> settings -> 

here we can define upto 3 servers
and in remote syslog content setting we can define which syslog messages we want to log: 

everything
system events
firewall events
dhcp service events
portal auth events
vpn (pptp , ipsec, openvpn events)
gateway monitor events
server load balancer events
wireless events

in mac there is syslog and in etc/asl.conf we have conf file.

sudo tail -f /var/log/system.log

console for macgui
syslog server for windows

logs are in raw format so we can get log analyzers.
