download hashcat.7z
extract
go to folder where hashcat.exe is located

our system must have OS and supported GPU.

download wordlist
paste it in folder with hashcat.exe file.

press shift in the folder, then open powershell window here.

this is the command for md5 password cracking

hashcat uses the hash modes as command line parameter


.\hashcat.exe -m 0 -a 0 hashes.txt rockyou.txt


.\hashcat.exe: This is the path to the program that we’re running. In this case, we’re running hashcat.exe, which is located in the current folder (.\).


-m 0 tells hashcat that it’s going to be cracking MD5 passwords. Hashcat assigns each supported algorithm a number that it calls a “hash mode”; since MD5 is so common for testing and practice, it was assigned 0. You can get a full list of hash modes from the hashcat website or by running .\hashcat.exe -h


-a 0 tells hashcat that we’re just using a simple word list attack. There are other attack modes with varying degrees of complexity; you can get a full list by running .\hashcat.exe -h

hashes.txt is the file that contains the hashes to be cracked, one per line.
rockyou.txt is an attack-mode-specific parameter. Each attack mode typically takes one or two additional parameters that are specified after the hash file. Since we’re using a basic word list attack, we specify one additional parameter: the word list file.
