1. OPEN - use real information about yourself and your identity.


2. AVOIDANCE - don't use social media , not having social media accounts.


3. AUDIENCE - keep seperate identities for each audience
make groups, because posts from for e.g facebook , linked in etc might be shared across applications.

for example for friends and family, we might use the same email id identity for facebook, instagram, whatsapp etc.

but for work places for e.g linkedin we might use a seperate identity.

4. CONTENT strategy - content that matches a consistent appearance for all people friends, family and others.

5. COMPARTMENTALIZATION - using seperate identity for everything.
