when we click a link, the browser loads it and tells us , where the webpage
came from.






As I said in the comment you can't hide the Referrer from the server side (as far as I know), but there are ways to do so.

Using a meta tag
You can tell the browser to not send a referrer by adding the meta element like this:

<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">
Using the referrerpolicy attribute (experimental)
You can add the referrerpolicy attribute to an anchor element (area, img, iframe and link too), it accepts the following value: no-referrer, no-referrer-when-downgrade, origin, origin-when-cross-origin, unsafe-url more details here.

Using the rel attribute
You can also pass noreferrer to the rel attribute, more details here

Using the Referrer-Policy HTTP header
This HTTP header allows you to set a policy about sending the referrer, documentation here, you can use it in PHP with the header() function like this:

header("Referrer-Policy: no-referrer");

Or in your case:

function redirect($url) {
    header("Referrer-Policy: no-referrer");
    header("Location: {$url}", true, 307);
}
This article explains this feature in more details.












this can be even in small image pixels, that are invisible on the website.
