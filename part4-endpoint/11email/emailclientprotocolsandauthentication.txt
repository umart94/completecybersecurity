webmail - gmail , outlook , etc. on browser
in webmail we access via https port 443 ( ssl / tls encrypted )
authentication is required
certificate of server is required
client - password or 2fa



email clients e.g thunderbird , outlook for windows :

protocols and ports :

imap port 143 ( unencrypted )
pop port 110 ( unencrypted )
imap port 993 ( ssl / tls encrypted )
pop3 port 995 ( ssl / tls encrypted )

imap is synced on clients and server  (server has master copy ) - use imap if laptop is vulnerable
pop is stored on client only - use pop if server is vulnerable.






authentication is 

server - certificate ( usually )
client - password / 2fa / ntlm / oauth2 / kerberos / gssapi / tls certificates



protocols and ports for sending email

port 25 smtp ( unencrypted )
smarttls 587 ( ssl/tls encrypted ) - more vulnerable to man in the middle attacks.
smtp port 465 ( ssl/tls encrypted ) - more secure than smarttls.

cipher suites

check them by using website like qualys ssl labs ( verifies the ssl certificates )

on kali linux - sslscan
