physically and logically putting devices on seperate networks.
and restricting how and when devices can communicate on each other..

if attacker or malware has compromised a system on a network,
then it can propagate to other devices on the network

network isolation mitigates this attack

IoT devices are extremely insecure.
with older linux kernels
not well maintained
have lots of vulnerabilities.

they are seen as appliances and are rampant for being insecure, and never updated.

especially if they are connected to the internet.

we need to keep these IoT devices on seperate networks.
we also need to control how, they might connect to the internet.
