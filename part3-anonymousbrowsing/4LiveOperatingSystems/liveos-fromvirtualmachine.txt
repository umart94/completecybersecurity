we make virtual machines and then add virtual disks to it

in this case we want to be able to boot a os in live mode
so that no data is persisted on disk

we can create virtual disk with it as well (if we want)



in vmware or virtualbox, create a new template.
select the os type from iso file
when creating a virtual machine , select do not add a virtual disk

live os can be persistant or non persistant

non-persistance - changes not retained

we can use usb with write locks.
