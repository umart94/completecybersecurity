in mozilla, enable a proxy
go to a website
use burp suite 

turn interceptor on
forward requests.

this will show us all the domains, that the website is connecting to.

we need to trust portswigger ca certificate.

instead
we can use burpsuite embedded browser, and use that to intercept requests.

we can see that 1 website links to another 3rd party website
and that 3rd party website will link to 4th party website and 
this forms a chain.

we can see which previous website referred us, to the next website in the chain

using the http-referer

there are methods to hids this.
