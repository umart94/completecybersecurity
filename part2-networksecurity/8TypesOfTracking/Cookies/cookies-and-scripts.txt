http is stateless
cookies allow to save something inside it

for e.g
if we log in, session cookies save session state ( on the client side)


scripts also have tracking code inside them.
analytics scripts
like buttons
subscribe buttons etc.
share buttons


if we are not loggedin, we are tracked using a cookie id number.

generate cookie id
capture session cookie , via mitm attack
relay into http header
login as that user.
