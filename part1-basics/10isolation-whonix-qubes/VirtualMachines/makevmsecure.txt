virtual isolation via vlan

virtual machine leaks

unwanted log files
disk caching

disabled drag and drop
video acceleration
serial ports
uninstall floppy cd dvd
virtual disks removed
disable usb

use ps/2 mouse instead.

to avoid someone getting access to the physical hard drive use a live operating system.

convert virtual disks to an iso and then boot from that ( use as live cd) )

after you perform the activities create a snapshot.. once malware has arrived
simply revert back to the previous most snapshot of the vm


keep the operating systems either logged off or switched off..

never keep them in sleep / hibernate / power saving modes.
or else the encrypted keys and password will be cached/ stored on your disks.
